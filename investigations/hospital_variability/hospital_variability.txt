This query computes the top 20 measures that display the most variability
across all hospitals.
It first joins the hospitals table with the effective_care and the mesures one
and then groups the joined table by mesureid before getting the max and min 
of the measure scores for each measureid. 
It then takes the difference of the max and min with the meausureid and 
measurename and orders the results by the difference in descending order.

The results of the execution of this query in descending order of variability
are listed in the table below.
