The query provided for this question returns the states that have the 
most hospitals that rate most ferquently in the top 1 of any of the
measured categories.
The query first joins the hospitals, measures and efective_care tables.
It then partitions the joined table on the measure ID and orders it by
descending scores for each measure and selects the institution rank 
as the top for the measure.
Institutions' states and their ranks are then counted and the ones that 
repeat most freqently as top 1 across all measures are selected as the best 
stats in the nation.
Note that this measure could be made proportional to the number of hospitals
in the state or to the population count in the state. It is not in the results
provided.

Using the method above, the top 10 states (in descending order) in the 
nation based on the data set in hand are listed below. The columns displayed are the state an the number of top 1 measures across all hospitals 
in the state.
