The query provicded for this question returns the hospitals that score at the
top of the overall_rating_achievement measure of the surveys.
The measure was previoulsy transformed to a floating point value in the
range [0-1].
The query joins hospitals and surveys_results and orders the hospital by the 
variable overall_rating_achiev in descending order.

Based on this process, the listing of the top 50 hospitals and their overall
rating achievement (last column) is provided below. Note that there are quite
many hospitals that score at a score of 1.0.
Taking all these 50 hospitals in consideration, and reviewing the hospitals
identified in the best hospitals indicates low correlation.
That may not be surprising as the measures computed in the data are very 
different from patient satisfactions ones.
